## 👋 Hi, I'm Mike

I build systems.

Lately I’ve been deep in:

- 🤖 AI agents (local ASR/LLM runtimes, tool execution frameworks)
- 🧠 Long-context reasoning and model orchestration
- 🖥️ Local-first AI (Docker, Ollama, GPU tuning, benchmarking)
- 📡 Embedded experimentation (SDR, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, telemetry dashboards)
- 🦀 Rust side projects and lightweight service layers
- ⚡ Event-driven systems and automation

---

## 🧪 Current Exploration Areas

### AI Agents & Runtime Systems
- Incident-style agent architectures
- Tool-augmented LLM design
- Memory strategies for autonomous agents
- Model switching and evaluation
- CLI-first agent workflows

### Local AI Infrastructure
- Self-hosted LLM stacks
- GPU benchmarking and optimization
- Containerized inference pipelines
- Structured prompts and tool contracts

### Hardware & Telemetry
- Arduino and Raspberry Pi data capture
- Rust-based dashboards (Axum)
- Sensor ingestion pipelines
- Edge → service data flows

---

## 🔧 Projects

- **arduino-labs** — Arduino experiments paired with a Rust telemetry dashboard
- **OpenClaw experiments** — CLI agent exploration and tool runtime testing
- Additional AI and systems prototypes (private repos)

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Agent orchestration architectures
- Scalable model execution strategies
- Efficient local compute design
